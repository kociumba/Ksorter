# ksorter
Simple PowerShell script to sort files in a directory by their extensions.

This script is integrated with my multipurpose cli tool [Ktool](https://github.com/kociumba)

# TODO
- so far errors when encountering duplicates in the sorting directory, i have a fix but i was too lazy to implement it yet
